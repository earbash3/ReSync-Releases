## Why ReSync

ReSync keeps your Rekordbox library aligned with your folder-organized music collection in a compare-first, approval-based workflow.

- Folder structure stays your source of truth
- Changes are visible before write
- Sync applies only what you explicitly approve

## Key Features

- Your music folder is the baseline
- Rekordbox comparison against current folder state
- Preview before any write operation
- Controlled sync after explicit approval

## How It Works

1. Open or import your Rekordbox library
2. Run Compare to detect differences
3. Review all proposed changes in Preview
4. Apply Sync only after confirmation

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Who is ReSync for?</summary>

ReSync is built for DJs who organize music in folders and treat folder structure as their primary system.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What does Compare do exactly?</summary>

It compares your music folders with your Rekordbox state and shows where differences exist. That result becomes the plan Sync can apply.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What do I see in Preview?</summary>

You see the exact tracks marked for addition or removal, so nothing happens blindly and you can decide before any write is applied.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens without a license?</summary>

The app remains usable for checking and review workflows, but write operations require an activated license.
