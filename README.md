## Why ReSync

If your real workflow lives in folders, ReSync keeps Rekordbox aligned with it.

No duplicate maintenance.
No manual import loops.
No pre-set surprises.

## How It Works

1. Open your library
2. Compare folders vs. Rekordbox
3. Review changes in preview
4. Apply sync when you approve

Simple, controlled, DJ-friendly.
