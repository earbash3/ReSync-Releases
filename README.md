## What is ReSync?

ReSync is built for DJs who organize their music in folders and want Rekordbox to follow that structure without repeated manual maintenance.

The core idea is simple:

- your folder structure stays the baseline
- ReSync compares that baseline against your Rekordbox library
- you review the plan before anything is written
- sync runs only after explicit approval

This keeps control in your hands while removing a large part of repetitive library admin.

## Why ReSync?

- 🎧 Built around a real DJ pain point: doing the same organizational work twice.
- 🔎 Compare-first workflow: clear visibility before any write operation.
- ✅ Approval-based execution: no blind background write process.
- 🧭 Folder-oriented model: your existing structure remains the source of truth.
- ⏱ Less admin overhead, more time for crate quality and set preparation.

## How it works

### 1) Open

Open or import your Rekordbox library data.

### 2) Compare

ReSync scans your selected music-folder structure and compares it with your current Rekordbox state.

### 3) Preview

You get a reviewable list of proposed additions/removals before any write step.

### 4) Sync

Changes are applied only after you confirm.
No confirmation means no write.

## What ReSync does and does not do

### ReSync does

- Keep folder-based and library-based states aligned through compare + approval.
- Show planned sync effects before apply.
- Help reduce repetitive manual playlist maintenance.

### ReSync does not

- Perform silent destructive operations in the background.
- Apply write changes without your confirmation.
- Replace your backup strategy.

## Safety first

- Always keep a recoverable backup before any write operation.
- Treat Preview as mandatory before Apply Sync.
- If output looks unexpected, stop and review before running Sync.

ReSync is designed for controlled changes, but operational safety still depends on your backup discipline.

## FAQ

### Is this for Rekordbox users only?

ReSync is focused on ongoing maintenance after that baseline exists.

### Can ReSync apply changes without review?

No. Review-before-apply is a core design choice.

### Does ReSync replace backups?

No. Backups are still mandatory operational safety.
