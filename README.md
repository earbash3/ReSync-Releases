## ❓ What is ReSync?

ReSync is built for DJs who organize their music in folders and want Rekordbox to follow that structure without repeated manual maintenance.

The core idea is simple:

- your folder structure stays the baseline
- ReSync compares that baseline against your Rekordbox library
- you review the plan before anything is written
- sync runs only after explicit approval

This keeps control in your hands while removing a large part of repetitive library admin.

## 🎧 Why ReSync?

- 🎧 Built around a real DJ pain point: doing the same organizational work twice.
- 🔎 Compare-first workflow: clear visibility before any write operation.
- ✅ Approval-based execution: no blind background write process.
- 🧭 Folder-oriented model: your existing structure remains the source of truth.
- ⏱ Less admin overhead, more time for crate quality and set preparation.

## ⚙️ How it works

### 1) 📂 Open

Open or import your Rekordbox library data.

### 2) 🔎 Compare

ReSync scans your selected music-folder structure and compares it with your current Rekordbox state.

### 3) 👀 Preview

You get a reviewable list of proposed additions/removals before any write step.

### 4) ✅ Sync

Changes are applied only after you confirm.
No confirmation means no write.

## 🛟 Safety first

- Always keep a recoverable backup before any write operation.
- Treat Preview as mandatory before Apply Sync.
- If output looks unexpected, stop and review before running Sync.

ReSync is designed for controlled changes, but operational safety still depends on your backup discipline.
