## Why ReSync

ReSync was built from a real DJ workflow pain point:

- You organize music once in folders.
- Then you repeat the same maintenance manually in Rekordbox.
- Over time it becomes slow, error-prone, and easy to miss tracks.

ReSync keeps your Rekordbox structure aligned with your folder workflow in a controlled, review-first flow.

## How It Works

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>1) Open</strong><br>Open or import your Rekordbox library.</td>
    <td><strong>2) Compare</strong><br>Detect differences between folders and Rekordbox.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>3) Preview</strong><br>Review all planned additions/removals before write.</td>
    <td><strong>4) Sync</strong><br>Apply changes only after explicit approval.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
