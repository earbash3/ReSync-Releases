## The Problem Every DJ Knows

You spend hours organizing your music folders.
Then you do the same work again in Rekordbox.

And when something is missing, you usually don't notice it at home.
You notice it in the middle of a set.

## Why ReSync Exists

ReSync was built by a home DJ and developer who got tired of maintaining the same library twice.

If your real workflow lives in Finder/Explorer and folder structure is your source of truth,
ReSync is built for you.

## What ReSync Does

ReSync treats your folder structure as the baseline and mirrors it to Rekordbox in a controlled flow.

- Reads your Rekordbox library
- Detects what changed in your folders
- Adds new tracks
- Removes deleted tracks
- Keeps the structure in sync

No manual import loops.
No playlist housekeeping marathon.
No "did I add this already?" anxiety.

## Real Workflow (DJ Speed)

1. Put new tracks into the right folder
2. Open
3. Compare
4. Sync
5. Done

You don't manage a library.
You DJ.
